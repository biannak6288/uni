How to help those in need 
UNI
Together we stand 
Info:
Uni is a non-profit organization which symbolizes those who are not able to stand up in society: socially and economically. We intend to assist those who don’t have many opportunities in terms of education, health and shelter.
The possibilities are endless and everyone should get a chance to experience them in any shape or form, therefore if you want to open up your heart to those who are not able to make a living on their own, then you have found the right place to help. 
Afraid your money won’t go towards the right cause? After you donate, we send you a picture with information of the family you are saving and giving a life long opportunity.

However, Uni specifically brought about a sense of security of where our money went because we didn’t only receive a warm “thank you,” but a picture of whom we helped and how. That is why my wife and I encourage all people who are willing to help those in need to donate and support this organization.”

Every time we donated, we asked the organization that the money be sent to one specific child in need, and we continued to watch her grow as she developed into a beautiful young lady. This helped us feel, once again, as if we are raising a child of our own.”

Therefore, whatever chance we get, we are willing to donate. Whether the amount is small or large, it doesn’t matter because we know that every little bit counts.”

[8]- http://hollywoodnewssource.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lin.jpg → “Uni is an oustanding program. I donated all the money sales from this year's production “Hamilton” towards this organization. My kids even enjoy receiving the letter from Uni in the mail of the next couple, child, or family that we helped because my wife and I encourage them to do good in the world just like us.”
Guide:
Not sure where to start? Here is the perfect guide for you
Research. Poverty is related in many ways to reproductive rights, workers rights and environmental justice. By learning about it, you can determine what to spend your time and efforts to help the poor get the skills and ability they need so they can help themselves.
Make Donations. Commit to giving up something special for yourself for a month and use the money you have saved to donate it to a local or international charity or non-profit organization such as the one we have available for you here. Apart from money, you can donate food, clothing, toiletries, furniture, toys, old books to program and local shelters. These donations help people in economic distress and will bring happiness to many people around the world.
Volunteer. There are endless ways to help the community by taking direct action. Here in UNI we have many seats available for people who would want to make a change. If you can not afford to contribute money or any kind of material, you can always help people by volunteering. Here, we qualify volunteers as the "fundamental support." In UNI, volunteering is made up of committed, active, courageous and motivated people. 
Spread the word. To advance in our path, we need to think of our goals, the utopia that will move our actions in the future and that will inspire the values on which rests our way of making cooperations. We need many people to not only find out about our organization, but also to realize the pain and suffrage that other people are going through.
